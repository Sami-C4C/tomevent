<h1>Event Tom Project</h1>

<p>
As part of the Software Quality project in the winter semester of 2023/2024, the Event Tom system is being developed. The aim is to create a platform that facilitates the management of events, customer administration, and ticket sales. Future enhancements will include features such as staff and equipment management as well as accounting. The current phase focuses on testing and improving the quality of the application layer of Event Tom, particularly through component and integration tests. This process partly follows the "Test Driven Development" (TDD) approach. The system, currently lacking a database and user interface, is supported by an existing partial implementation. The primary goal is to enhance the quality of the code through a structured and tool-assisted approach, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future expansions.
